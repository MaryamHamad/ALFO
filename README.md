**Please find the results video for real and synthetic 4D light field images in the file entitled Alfo.mp4**

**The label images generated from our method can be found in (ALFO label images for HCI dataset) folder in this repository with superpixel size = 20. 
Additionally, a demo code is uploaded to show the labeled images in random colors or overlayed in top of the original light field images.**
