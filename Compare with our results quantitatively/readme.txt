To compare with our results for HCI dataset for the following images:
Used images: {'buddha', 'papillon', 'horses', 'stillLife'}
Used superpixel sizes: {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40} for each image

--------------

you can find all the evaluation metrics that used and explained in the paper arranged as follows:
In (ALFO-results.mat) file you can find6 deferent metrics namely:
Achievable Accuracy: aa
Under-segmentation error: ue
Boundary Recall: br
Compactness: cp
Self-similarity: ss
Label per Pixel error: lp

---------

In each metric (i), you will find the file arrages in this way:
Results for buddha for metric (i) for {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}  sizes
Results for papillon for metric (i) for {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}  sizes
Results for horses for metric (i) for {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}  sizes
Results for stillLife for metric (i) for {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}  sizes
